# Profilarr

Profilarr is a Python-based tool designed to add import/export/sync functionality to the \*arr suite. It offers a user-friendly way to export existing custom formats / profiles, import new ones or sync a master instance of Radarr / Sonarr with extras.

## ⚠️ Before Continuing

- **This tool will overwrite any custom formats in your \*arr installation that have the same name.**
- **Always back up your Radarr and Sonarr configurations before using Profilarr to avoid unintended data loss.** (Seriously, do it. Even I've lost data to this tool because I forgot to back up my configs.)

## 🛠️ Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- Radarr / Sonarr

### 📦 Dependencies

- run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install dependencies.

### Initial Setup

1. Download the latest Profilarr package from the release section.
2. Extract its contents into a folder.
3. Run `python setup.py` in your command line interface to generate a config file.
   - This will create a `config.yml` file in the same directory as `setup.py`.
4. Open the `config.yml` file in a text editor.
   - Add the URL and API key to the master instances of Radarr / Sonarr.
   - If syncing, add the URL, API key and a name to each extra instance of Radarr / Sonarr.
   - If exporting, adjust the `export_path` to your desired export location.
   - If importing non Dictionarry files, adjust the `import_path` to your desired import location.
5. Save the changes.

## 🚀 Usage

### Importing

Note: For users who start using Profilarr before v0.3, you no longer need to manually import custom formats. They will be imported automatically. Quality Profiles still require manual selection.

1. If importing Dictionarry files, make sure the import path is `./imports` (This is the default path).
2. If importing non Dictionarry files, make sure the import path is set to your desired import location.
3. Run `python importarr.py` in your command line interface.
4. Follow the on-screen prompts to select your desired app and which instance(s) to import to.
5. Choose your desired quality profile(s) to import.

#### Example: Importing 1080p Transparent and 2160p Optimal Quality Profiles

### Exporting

1. Make sure the export path is set to your desired export location. The default is `./exports`.
2. Run `python exportarr.py` in your command line interface.
3. Follow the on-screen prompts to select your desired app and which instance(s) to export from.
4. Choose the data you want to export.
5. The data will be exported to `exports/{data_type}/{app}/`.

#### Example

```bash
Select your app of choice
1. Radarr
2. Sonarr
Enter your choice:
1
Select your Radarr instance
1. Radarr (Master)
2. Radarr (4k-radarr)
Choose an instance by number, multiple numbers separated by commas or type 'all' for all instances:

Exporting Custom Formats for Radarr : 4k-radarr
Exported 134 custom formats to ./exports/custom_formats/Radarr for 4k-radarr

Exporting Quality Profiles for Radarr : 4k-radarr...
Exported 2 quality profiles to ./exports/quality_profiles/Radarr for 4k-radarr
```

### Syncing

1. Make sure the import path is set to whatever your export path is. This is important, as the script will look for the exported files in this location.
1. Run `python syncarr.py` in your command line interface.
1. The script will automatically export data from the master instance and import it to all other instances specified in `config.json`.

#### Example

```bash
PS Z:\Profilarr> py syncarr.py
Select your app of choice
1. Radarr
2. Sonarr
Enter your choice:

### Radarr and Sonarr Compatibility

- You are only able to import / sync files to the app that is included in the file name (e.g. `Radarr` or `Sonarr`).
- It is possible to manually rename the files to import them to the other app, but this is not recommended.
  - Custom Formats will succesfully import, but will require manual editing to work with the other app, i.e. you must adjust the quality sources to match the other app's naming scheme.
  - Quality Profiles will not import at all, as they are not compatible with the other app. It is possible to import them manually by editing the json directly, but this is not recommended.
  - In future, I may add a feature to automatically convert profiles between the two apps, but this is not currently a priority.

## 🌟 Upcoming Features

- **Lidarr Support:** Expand functionality to include Lidarr, allowing users to manage music quality profiles and custom formats.
- **User Interface (UI):** Development of a graphical user interface (GUI) for easier and more intuitive interaction with Profilarr. This UI will cater to users who prefer graphical over command-line interactions.
- **Automatic Updates:** Implement an auto-update mechanism for Profilarr, ensuring users always have access to the latest features, improvements, and bug fixes without manual intervention.

## Contributing

- I've added a docker compose file for testing custom formats / quality profiles. Run `docker-compose up -d` to start the Radarr/ Sonarr test containers. Add your API keys to the `config.yml` file and begin testing!

# TRaSH Guides

Some custom formats found here have been interated on from the trash guides. Credit for these goes entirely to trash, and can be found on their site here. It is not my intention to steal their work, but rather to build on it and make it more accessible to the average user through my quality profiles. Please check out their site for more information on their work.
